Baby be mine
Baby be mine
Till the end of time
I love you (baby)
Baby (baby) be mine

I've always wanted you
Baby please hold me tight
And say you'll want me too
When we're all alone tonight
I just adore you
I knew it when I first saw you

Baby be mine
Baby be mine
Till the end of time
I love you (baby)
Baby (baby) be mine

Oh I can't picture you
By anyone elses side
And I can't picture me
As anyone elses bride
So I've been yearning
Can't you hear my heart saying

Baby be mine
Baby be mine
Till the end of time
I love you (baby)
Baby (baby) be mine

I promise that I will be true
I'll give my heart & soul to you
Baby be mine
Baby be mine
Till the end of time
I love you (baby)
Baby (baby) be mine

(Baby be mine) Ohhhh baby
(Baby be mine) Oh oh baby
