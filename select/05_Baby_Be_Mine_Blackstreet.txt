Now is the time, and here's the place
I Want...
The Glow of Love is on your Face
I Want...
Don't Be Afraid, just come to me
I want...
For your Lovin', I've been waitin patiently

So come closer please, and I will show you the way
Love & Extasy tonight!
Cause It's hard to find
Real love, so baby won't you try me
And forever you will be mine

I Want You, I Need You (Girl)
Baby, Baby Want You be mine? (Baby Please)
I Want You, I Need You
Baby, Baby Lets spend some time

(Rap)

So let's not waste Time,
Live is to short, for if's and maybe's
I wan't you to tell me right now
That you're good to go
And we will flow to the swing
And forever you will be mine

I Want You, I Need You
Baby, Baby Want You be mine? (Won't you be mine, won't you be mine?)
I Want You, I Need You
Baby, Baby Lets spend some time (Baby we could spend a little Time)

You Got it goin' on
To the break-a-break of dawn
From Your Head to your toes
Cause Blackstreet knows
