You and I
We Were Made For Each Other
Lovers Know
There's a Way that We Can Tell
You and I
We Were Legendary Lovers
By the Way Girl
There's Something on My Mind

Many Days
We Don't Even See Each Other
And Little Things
We Don't Even See a Change
If You and I
Could Steal An Extra Moment
I Would Call You on the Phone
Just to Tell You I'll Be Home
At This Time

Baby Be Mine (Tonight)
Your Love Makes It All So Right
Baby Please Let Me have Tonight
Your Love is All I'm Living For

Many Times
I Need Your Conversation
And Other Times
Just To Tell a Joke Or Two
Sing the Song
Touching Your Emotions
Anything Girl
Just to Get Next To You

Maybe I Could Sing a Little Song
I Would Get Down On My Knees
Just to Sing This Melody (Ha!)
Might As Well

Baby Be Mine (Tonight)
Your Love Makes It All So Right
Baby Please Let Me Have Tonight
Your Love is All I'm Living For

(Oh Baby).Please Be Mine Tonight.
(Oh Yeah)...(Whoo)
Let Me Have Tonight
Your Love Is All That I'm Living For
(Woo-Ooo)
Baby Don't U know That I'm a Fool For Ya

I'll Stay Up All Night Waiting For Ya
Baby Don't Make a Grown Man
Beg and Cry For More (No No)
(Baby) So Please Let Me have Tonight
Your Love Is All
That I'm Living For (Baby)

Oh Baby... Oh Baby (Be Mine)
Baby Be Mine.Oh Girl (Ha!)
You Just keep Me Up All Night
Baby.Making Love... Anything U Want
You Can Get It From Me Baby
You Know That
