[00:19.77] I don't need no dreams when I'm by your side, ooh-ooh
[00:28.92] Every moment takes me to paradise
[00:35.40] Darling, let me hold you
[00:40.13] I'll warm you in my arms and melt your fears away
[00:46.32] Show you all the magic that a perfect love can make
[00:54.37] I need you night and day
[01:06.37] 
[00:56.59] So baby, be mine (Baby, you got to be mine)
[01:01.10] And girl I'll give you all I got to give
[01:05.02] So baby, be my girl (All the time)
[01:10.02] And we can share this ecstasy
[01:11.93] As long as we believe in love
[01:26.43] 
[01:23.50] I won't give you reason to change your mind
[01:29.99] (I can't sit still, you thrill me, baby, be mine)
[01:32.56] You are all the future that I desire
[01:39.36] Girl, I need to hold you
[01:43.34] Share my feelings in the heat of love's embrace
[01:49.61] Show you all the passion burning in my heart today
[01:58.17] It's never going to fade
[02:10.17] 
[01:59.91] So baby, be mine (Baby, you got to be mine)
[02:04.72] And girl I'll give you all I got to give
[02:08.54] So baby, be my girl (All the time)
[02:13.54] You're everything this world could be
[02:15.71] The reason that I live, oh
[02:28.71] 
[02:18.46] Won't you stay with me until the morning sun
[02:22.68] I promise you now that the dawn will be different
[02:27.13] Lady can't you see that heaven's just begun
[02:31.66] It's living here inside our hearts
[02:48.66] 
[02:37.75] There'll be no more mountains for us to climb
[02:43.89] (I can't be still, you thrill me, baby, be mine)
[02:46.72] This will be a love lasting for all time
[02:53.36] Girl, you got to hold me
[02:57.87] We can touch the sky and light the darkest day
[03:04.05] Hold me, only you and I can make sweet love this way
[03:12.36] There's no more I can say
[03:24.86] 
[03:14.30] So baby, be mine (Baby be mine, baby you got to be mine)
[03:19.17] And girl I'll give you all I got to give (Say you're thinking of me)
[03:23.13] So baby, be my girl (All the time, show me how it should be, hold me tight)
[03:28.00] You're everything this world could be (Every night)
[03:29.97] The reason that I live (It's alright, every night)
[03:54.97] 
[03:31.95] Baby, be my girl (Tell me that you love me, all the time)
[03:36.62] And girl I'll give you all I got to give (Say you're thinking of me)
[03:40.60] So baby, be mine, baby, be mine (Show me how it should be, hold me tight)
[03:45.35] You're everything this world could be to me (Every night, it's alright)
[04:20.85] 
[03:49.41] C'mon, girl, c'mon, girl (Tell me that you love me, all the time)
[03:56.67] (Say you're thinking of me)
[03:57.91] So baby, be mine (Show me how it should be, hold me tight)
[04:02.96] You're everything this world could be to me (Every night, it's alright)
[04:07.68] C'mon, girl, c'mon, girl (Tell me that you love me, all the time)
[04:11.49] Baby be mine (All the time)
